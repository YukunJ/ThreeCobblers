To create a kubernetes cluster on AWS, you need to do the following:
(mostly from the primier + personal debugging experience)

0. Make sure you have aws command line, helm, kops installed already
(Assume you already have the first 2, 
to install kops on Mac, do 'brew update && brew install kops' if you have brew
otherwise, check 'https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/getting_started/install/' to pick an option

1. If working locally, check your aws user by 'aws configure' 
   and set to the user you want to use by access key and secret key

2. Important! Go to aws console, search "I AM", click, pick out that user
   In permissions section, add permission, create a new group with full access (first one)
   and add this user into that group. Otherwise you won't be able to create bucket in Terraform

3. cd to the bucket folder, 'terraform init && terraform apply'. The bucker name should be printed out on the screen.

4. export the bucket name by 'export KOPS_STATE_STORE=s3://[bucket-name]', fill the bracket []

5. cd to the cluster folder

6. run 'kops create -f cluster.yaml,ig-master.yaml,ig-nodes.yaml'
   change the image weblink and machine type in the .yaml file there

7. add the ssh key file name by do 'kops edit cluster cluster.k8s.local'
   you will enter a vim mode, go to the line where says

  spec:
    sshKeyName: key_pair_name
    additionalPolicies: ...
    ....very very long stuff down below....

   For example. my key file is called freetier.pem, 
   then I will replace 'key_pair_name' by 'freetier', no '.pem' needed

8. then ':wq' exit the vim, do 
'kops update cluster --name cluster.k8s.local --yes --admin=2400h'

9. wait for around 10 minutes by do 'kops validate cluster --wait 10m'
   it's really slow, I succeed at around 9 minutes. 
   You will find at first it's all saying "no such host ...", just wait patiently

10. add the ELB controller, which can control the ingress by doing
   'helm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts'
   'helm repo update'
   'helm install aws-load-balancer-controller eks/aws-load-balancer-controller -n kube-system --set clusterName=cluster.k8s.local'

11. install ingress backend controller by running 'helm install my-nginx stable/nginx-ingress'

12. cd to Ingress Folder, do 'kubectl create -f ingress.yaml' and check by 'kubectl get ingress' to see if the ingress deployment is successful or nor

13. Finally do 'helm install [applicationName] [folder]'

You are ready to go!
